He has some neck pain at times and has seen Dr. X for an epidural steroid injection, which was very helpful. More recently he saw Dr. Y and went through some physical therapy without much relief.\nCervical MRI scan was obtained and revealed a large right-sided disc herniation at C4-5 with significant midline herniations at C5-6 and a large left HNP at C6-7. In view of the multiple levels of pathology, I was not confident that anything short of surgical intervention would give him significant relief. The procedure and its risk were fully discussed and he decided to proceed with the operation.",
